System Design Interview Clean Rubrics
 
1. Problem Understanding & Requirement Gathering
How well the candidate clarifies scope, asks relevant questions, and identifies key constraints through dialogue
Evidence: Questions about scale, users, features; clarifying edge cases; quantifying targets (QPS, storage, users)

2. Structured Problem-Solving Approach
Candidate's ability to break down the problem systematically and communicate their thought process clearly
Evidence: Logical progression, organized thinking, clear communication of next steps, building incrementally

3. High-Level Architecture & Design Evolution
How the candidate develops and refines their architecture through the conversation turns
Evidence: Component identification, service boundaries, data flow explanation, architecture refinement based on follow-up questions


4. Technical Depth & Implementation Details
Candidate's ability to dive deeper when prompted and provide concrete technical solutions
Evidence: Database choices, API designs, algorithms, data structures, specific technologies mentioned with justification

5. Scalability & Performance Reasoning
How candidate addresses scale challenges and performance bottlenecks through the dialogue
Evidence: Scaling strategies, bottleneck identification, load handling, caching strategies, partitioning approaches

6. Trade-off Analysis & Decision Justification
Candidate's ability to compare alternatives and justify decisions when challenged by interviewer
Evidence: Pros/cons discussion, CAP theorem application, cost vs. performance trade-offs, explaining why option A over B

7. Handling Follow-up Questions & Adaptability
How well candidate responds to interviewer's probing questions and adapts their design
Evidence: Thoughtful responses to edge cases, design modifications, handling interviewer challenges, admitting unknowns appropriately

8. Reliability & Fault Tolerance Considerations
Candidate's awareness of failure modes and resilience strategies when prompted
Evidence: Discussing single points of failure, replication, disaster recovery, circuit breakers when asked

9. Communication & Collaboration
Clarity of explanation, engagement with interviewer, and collaborative problem-solving style
Evidence: Clear explanations, good use of examples, asking for clarification, collaborative tone


10. Completeness & Time tracking
How well the candidate covers the problem scope within the conversation flow
Evidence: Addressing most important aspects, not getting stuck on details, progressing through the design

Scoring Scale (0-2):
0: Not addressed or fundamentally incorrect responses
1: Basic responses with some correct elements
2: Excellent, detailed responses demonstrating expertise
